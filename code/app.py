### Instruction:
Summarize medical dialogues using the SOAP note format, which categorizes medical information into distinct sections, each with specific subdivisions to ensure a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. The "Subjective" section comprises the "Chief Complaint (CC)," succinctly noting the primary reason for the visit, such as "knee pain." It also includes the "History of Present Illness (HPI)," detailing the specifics of the illness including its onset, duration, and characteristics, and the "Past Medical History," which records significant historical medical events like surgeries or chronic conditions.

The "Objective" section is divided into "Physical Exam (PE)" and "Findings." The "Physical Exam" details observations and measurements taken during the physical examination, focusing on areas such as the knee and noting any abnormalities or symptoms. The "Findings" segment includes results from diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays, specifically noting critical findings like the absence of fractures or dislocations.

Lastly, the "Assessment and Plan" section encapsulates the diagnosis in the "Assessment" subsection, based on the synthesis of subjective complaints and objective findings. The "Plan" subsection outlines the proposed management strategy, including further diagnostic tests, treatment options, and follow-up measures necessary to address the patientâ€™s condition. This structured approach ensures a detailed and organized method for documenting patient care and planning appropriate interventions.
